# 🌟 Welcome to @YggdrasilWotLK! 🌟

Hey there! I'm the main maintainer and developer of Yggdrasil WoW 🌳, an AzerothCore-based WotLK 3.3.5a private server. When I author code, I mostly go by 'mostly nick :)'. I'm passionate about writing code in Python 🐍 and ELUNA LUA ⚙️. 

### 🚀 **What I Do:** 

**Python Development** 🧑‍💻: From automating tasks to managing data and crafting scripts, Python is my go-to language.  
**ELUNA LUA Scripting** 💡: Efficient and streamlined, LUA is key to many of my scripting projects, especially for WoW. 
**World of Warcraft Private Server Management** 🏰: I manage the Yggdrasil server, creating a fair, fun, and community-driven WoW experience for players. 
### 🔥 **Projects:**

**Python Scripts** 📜: Explore my Python utilities and automation scripts to see how I simplify workflows.  
**LUA Scripts** 🔧: From WoW addons to ELUNA game modifications, LUA is a powerful tool in my arsenal.  
**WoW Private Server** 🐉: Dive into Yggdrasil, where you'll find a vibrant community, balanced gameplay, and a rich game world.
