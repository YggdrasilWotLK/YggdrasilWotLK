# 🌟 Welcome to @YggdrasilWotLK! 🌟

Hey there! I'm the main maintainer and developer of Yggdrasil WoW 🌳, an AzerothCore-based WotLK 3.3.5a private server. When I author code, I mostly go by 'mostly nick :)'. I'm passionate about writing code in Python 🐍 and ELUNA LUA ⚙️.

### 🚀 **What I Do:**

**Python Development** 🧑‍💻: From automating tasks to managing data and crafting scripts, Python is my go-to language.
**ELUNA LUA Scripting** 💡: Efficient and streamlined, LUA is key to many of my scripting projects, especially for WoW.
**World of Warcraft Private Server Management** 🏰: I manage the Yggdrasil server, creating a fair, fun, and community-driven WoW experience for players.
### 🔥 **Projects:**

**LUA Scripts** 🔧: From WoW addons to ELUNA game modifications, LUA is a powerful tool in my arsenal.
