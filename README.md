# Welcome to @YggdrasilWotLK!

Hey there! I'm the main maintainer and developer of Yggdrasil WoW 🌳, an AzerothCore-based WotLK 3.3.5a private server. When I author code, I mostly go by 'mostly nick :)'. I'm passionate about writing code in Python 🐍 and ELUNA LUA ⚙️. 

### 🚀 **What I Do:** 

**ELUNA LUA Scripting** 💡: LUA is my go-to for game development and scripting. I especially use the ELUNA LUA engine for AzerothCore and TrinityCore scripting, bug fixing and feature development. This is my main competence and I spend roughly 10-15 hours a week of my development time on LUA.  

**Python Development** 🧑‍💻: I use Python for data processing, conversion and WoW macro creation from .LUA files. I spend some 5-10 hours a week on this.  

**Web Development** ☁️: When it comes to integrating the services above with the outside world, I work with HTML, CSS, PHP and JS. I spend some 5-10 hours a week on these languges.  

**MySQL Database Management** 🗃️: I'm interested in load optimizations of MySQL databases, query executions, and more. I spend some 1-5 hours a week on this depending on the workload present.  

**World of Warcraft Private Server Management** 🏰: I manage the Yggdrasil server, creating a fair, fun, and community-driven WoW WotLK experience for players.
